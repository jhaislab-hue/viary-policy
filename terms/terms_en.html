            <p>Article 3 (Posting and Amendment of Terms)<br>1. The Company shall post these Terms within the App where Members can easily access them.<br>2. The Company may amend these Terms to the extent that it does not violate relevant laws, such as the Act on the Regulation of Terms and Conditions of Korea.<br>3. When the Terms are amended, the Company will provide notice of the effective date and the reason for the amendment. Notice will be given at least seven (7) days prior to the effective date. However, if the changes are unfavorable to the Member, notice will be given at least thirty (30) days in advance.</p>
            <p>Article 4 (Provision and Changes of the Service)<br>1. The Company provides services including, but not limited to, voice recording, memo management, data visualization, and AI-powered features.<br>2. The Company reserves the right to change the contents, technical specifications, or other aspects of the Service for operational or technical reasons. In such cases, the Company will provide prior notice to the Members.</p>
            <p>Article 5 (Obligations of Members)<br>The Member agrees not to engage in any of the following acts:<br>1. Impersonating others or falsely stating one's relationship with others.<br>2.

            <p>Article 6 (Copyright and Management of Content)<br>1. The Member retains all ownership rights and copyrights to the Content they create.<br>2. The Service is designed to store Content exclusively on the Member's local device. The Company does not collect or store Member Content on its servers. Consequently, deleting the App or changing devices may result in the permanent loss of Content.<br>3. For the use of specific features like AI analysis, minimal necessary data may be temporarily sent to an external API as detailed in our Privacy Policy.<br>4. All intellectual property rights related to the Service itself, including its design, text, graphics, and code, belong to the Company.</p>
            <p>Article 7 (Paid Services)<br>1. The fees and conditions for any Paid Service will be clearly posted within the App.<br>2. Payments for Paid Services are processed through third-party app marketplaces, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.<br>3.

            <p>Article 8 (Termination of Contract and Restriction of Use)<br>1. A Member may terminate their service agreement at any time by deleting their account through the functionality provided within the App.<br>2. If a Member violates their obligations under these Terms (as outlined in Article 5), the Company may, after prior notification, restrict their use of the Service or terminate the agreement.</p>
            <p>Article 9 (Disclaimer of Liability)<br>The Company shall not be liable for any failure to provide the Service in the following cases, unless there is willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Company:<br>1. In the event of a natural disaster or other force majeure events.<br>2. In the event of a service disruption caused by the Member's own fault, such as device malfunction or incorrect data management.<br>3.

            <p>Article 10 (Governing Law and Dispute Resolution)<br>1. These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Korea.<br>2. The Company and the Member shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute arising out of or in connection with the Service through amicable negotiations.<br>3. If a dispute is not resolved through negotiation, it may be brought before the competent courts under the Korean Civil Procedure Act. However, if the laws in the Member's country of residence grant the Member a mandatory right to bring proceedings in their local courts, this provision does not prevent them from exercising that right.</p>
