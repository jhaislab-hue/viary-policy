		<h2>1. Overview</h2>
		<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Viary ("we", "us", the "App") collects, uses, stores, shares, and deletes personal information, and informs you of your rights. We follow global privacy principles (data minimization, purpose limitation, storage limitation, integrity/confidentiality, transparency).</p>

		<h2>4. Retention</h2>
		<p>We process/retain data only for lawful periods or as consented.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Account: Upon your deletion request, your account is immediately disabled. Following a 30-day grace period, your account and all associated data are permanently deleted. This grace period is set to prevent fraudulent use and to support account recovery.</li>
			<li>Subscription/Payment records: Retained per applicable e-commerce/tax laws (typically 5 years)</li>

			<li>Exception (AI features): If you choose AI analysis/summary, voice data is sent ephemerally to Google Gemini API and deleted immediately after processing.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>5. Deletion Procedures & Methods</h2>
		<p>We delete data without undue delay when the retention period ends or the purpose is fulfilled. Electronic files are irreversibly deleted; paper records are shredded/incinerated.</p>
		<p>As an exception, for account deletion requests (per Article 4, Item 1), the account is immediately disabled, and the permanent destruction process will begin after the 30-day grace period has elapsed.</p>

		<h2>8. Your Rights and How to Exercise Them</h2>

You may also withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. Use the in-app account deletion feature or contact: jhaislab@gmail.com. We will respond without undue delay and inform you if any legal grounds require refusal.</p>
